Advisory Service</b><br>
A few basic tips to follow:
<p>You can subscribe to our Keyword Advisory Service to <u>instantly</u>
receive an e-mail copy of every <b>newly</b> posted AD containing the "<b>keywords</b>"
in your subscription.
<p>As each <b>new</b> AD is posted, it is searched for your keywords. If
found, a <b>copy</b> of the AD is sent to the <b>e-mail address</b>
entered with your Advisory subscription.
<p>You can <b>modify</b> your subscription at any time. <b>Change</b>
the keywords or E-mail address used to receive AD copies.
<p><b>UNsubscribe</b> at any time when you no longer wish to receive AD
notices.
<p>All subscriptions automatically "<b>expire</b>" in either <b>30, 60,
or 90 days</b>. You select <u>when</u>.
<p>Enter <i><b>meaningful</b></i> keywords in your subscription. In most
cases, the keywords should be "<b>singular</b>". Such as: <b>boat</b>,
not <b>boats</b>, etc.<br>
<b>Note:</b> only <b>alpha</b> (a-z) and <b>numeric</b> (0-9) characters
are accepted in keywords...
