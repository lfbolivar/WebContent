tips to follow when posting an AD on our system...<br>
</b>
<ul>
	<li>Only post ADs for <b>Los Cabos Region</b> properties, goods or
	services.</li>
	<li>Include a <b>VALID email address</b> with your AD. It will not be
	shown to visitors but is required so the AD system and those interested
	in your AD can communicate with you. If our greeting email to you is
	returned as undeliverable <b>your AD will be deleted</b>.</li>
	<li>Post your AD in the most <b>relevant</b> category.</li>
	<li>Do not type your AD or title in <b>ALL CAPS</b>. Use <b>upper and
	lower case</b> when filling in your information. ADs in <b>ALL CAPS</b>
	will either be deleted or converted to lower case.</li>
	<li>Do not place <b>multiple ADs</b> for the same item or property.
	Duplicate ADs will be deleted.</li>
	<li>Do not <b>delete and resubmit</b> an AD. You may edit an AD until
	it expires.</li>
	<li><b>NO html tags!</b> They are stripped from all ADs.</li>
	<li><b>Check your spelling!</b></li>
</ul>
<b>Please observe these rules or your ad may be edited or deleted.</b> </font>
