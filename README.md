###Synopsis
This project initially set out to develop a procedural php application to post classified advertisements on the internet.  I am now looking to take parts of the code and apply in relevant places an Object Oriented Programming approach to enhance the functionality and configuration of the Gallery and PrivateWorkbench through abstraction.  This method should allow a variety of data or content management applications to easily customize the existing algorithm of the main procedural loop.
